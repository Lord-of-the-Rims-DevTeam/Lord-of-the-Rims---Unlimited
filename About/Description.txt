   This is a silly version of a real mod called The Third Age.
The Third Age is a mod that limits technology to the medieval period.
That mod also adds items and rebalances how resources work in RimWorld.
This mod is a duplicate of that mod, and it simply does not include the
technology limits of the other mod.    
    
What's inside?
This mod: does not remove modern items.
" adds salted pots and pantries to manage food without refrigeration
" adds a blacksmith forge to forge steel.
" adds iron and mithril.
" rebalances iron into the primary mineable resource, rather than steel.
